 - A Higher Order function is a function, which is capable of 
   doing any one of the following things:
    
    - It can be functioned as a data and be assigned to a variable.
    - It can accept any other function as an argument.
    - It can return a function as its result.
    - The ability to build Higher order functions, allows a
      programmer to create Closures, which in turn are used to
      create Decorators.
