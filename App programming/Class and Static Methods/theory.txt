You have read about function, higher order function, closures etc. Now, it is time to learn
about their scope. Based on the scope, functions/methods are of two types. They are:
  - Class methods
  - Static methods
  
Class Methods
  - A method defined inside a class is bound to its object, by default.
  - However, if the method is bound to a Class, then it is known as classmethod.
  - Consider the following two examples:
    - Example 1 defines the method getCirclesCount, bound to an object of Circle class.
    - Example 2 defines the classmethod getCirclesCount, bound to class Circle.


Static Method

  - A method defined inside a class and not bound to either a class or an object is known as Static Method.
  - Decorating a method using @staticmethod decorator makes it a static method.
  - Consider the following two examples:
    - Example 1 defines the method square , outside the class definition of Circle, and uses
      it inside the class Circle.
    - Example 2 defines the static method square, inside the class Circle, and uses it.
