- An Abstract Base Class or ABC mandates the derived classes to implement specific
  methods from the base class.
- It is not possible to create an object from a defined ABC class.
- Creating objects of derived classes is possible only when derived classes override
  existing functionality of all abstract methods defined in an ABC class.
